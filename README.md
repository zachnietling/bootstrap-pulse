# bootstrap-pulse
CSS pulse animation effects for Twitter Bootstrap buttons (works for many other elements also)

Example may be seen at https://jsfiddle.net/u6f5phz3/3/

One need only add a "pulse-primary" class (or any other Bootstrap color scheme) to an element, and it will pulse that color!


Default color classes:   
pulse-primary  
pulse-info  
pulse-warning  
pulse-danger  
pulse-default  
pulse-success
